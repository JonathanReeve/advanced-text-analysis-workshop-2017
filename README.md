# Workshop in Text Analysis with Python and SpaCy

This is the third revision of an intermediate / advanced workshop in text analysis with Python and SpaCy, first given at NYCDH in 2017, later that year at PyData (Microsoft), and most recently through Foundations for Research Computing at the Columbia University libraries.

Everything here *should* work out of the box if you import this notebook into a Google Colab notebook.
